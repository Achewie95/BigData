This project employs big data technologies, including Hadoop, Hive, Spark, and Zeppelin, to analyze major crimes in Toronto from 2014 onward. 
Utilizing the authoritative Major Crime Indicator dataset, we implemented a logical model, crime_view, for efficient analysis. Temporal insights highlight dynamic crime trends, while geographic analysis identifies the top 5 regions with both high andlow crime numbers. 
Pattern analysis reveals assault as the predominant crime category and provides insights into crime distribution across different premises. This study introduces practical business applications regarding urban safety in Toronto.
